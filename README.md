## Today i learnt about third man run and how they are important.
### Third man can be used to pass the ball to another player who is being blocked or marked. Basically the players attract the players and then that opposition player creates space and then the ball is played in that space to his team mate. Also, some players utilise the half space runs and wingers outwide beinng tracked out by the defender, can pass the ball to them in the halfspace to create a attack or can use the thirdman run in half space as decoy.
